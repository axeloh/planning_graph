# Planning Graphs
Implementing a graph planner as a part of an assignment in the subject *TDT4136 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence*.


## The “story” of the assignment
You wish to repaint your living room in new colors. The wall and the mouldings around the window are
to be painted separately in different colors. You have a paint brush and a paint roller available. The paint
roller can be used on either the wall or the mouldings. The paint brush is too small to be used on the
wall, so it is only useful for the mouldings. Once a paint utility has been used on either the wall or the
mouldings, it is covered in paint of that color and cannot be used to paint the other surface (because you
want different colors for the wall and the mouldings). There are pictures hanging on the wall that must be
removed before the wall can be painted—but the job is not done until these pictures are back on the wall.
